  This repository contains a set of matlab files that contain all the subprocesses of the simplex method. There is also a test case script that runs the simplex method on a simple problem. 
  
  To enact my example case place all the files in your active matlab directory and run the script entitled testCase.m.
  
  The simplexMethod.m is the main function and loops through all of the necessary steps. It calls all of the other functions in order to carry out specific pieces of functionality.
